# IoT Attack and Security Analysis in Edge Computing Network
The IoT Attack and Security Analysis in Edge Computing Networks is a project focused on detecting and mitigating cyberattacks targeting IoT devices in real-time using machine learning techniques and edge computing. This framework leverages the capabilities of edge nodes, such as a Raspberry Pi, to process and analyze data locally, minimizing latency and enhancing security.

The system integrates IoT devices, including a smart environmental monitoring sensor (DHT11 for temperature and humidity) and a smart bulb, to demonstrate practical IoT device management. The project simulates several common attack scenarios, such as Denial of Service (DoS), Command and Control (C&C) attacks, Horizontal Port Scans, and File Downloads. Machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ensemble are employed for intrusion detection, achieving up to 94.85% accuracy in attack classification. Specifically, the Random Forest model achieved 83.36% accuracy, the Ensemble model reached 94.60% accuracy, and the XGBoost model provided the highest performance with 94.85% accuracy, ensuring robust classification of IoT attacks such as Command and Control (C&C), Denial of Service (DoS), Horizontal Port Scans, and File Downloads.

The framework offers real-time alerts and mitigation capabilities, providing a user-friendly web interface where users can view device statuses, attack logs, and control IoT devices. The system also allows for blocking attackers' IP addresses and downloading detailed logs for further analysis, ensuring rapid response to security threats.

Key tools used in the project include hardware components like the Raspberry Pi 4, DHT11 sensor, and a GPIO-controlled smart bulb, along with software tools such as Python, Flask, TensorFlow, Wireshark, and tcpdump. Machine learning models are trained on the IoT-24 dataset, providing accurate attack classification. Visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to offer data insights through graphs and charts.

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining edge computing with machine learning to enhance the security of IoT networks. It provides a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly solution for detecting and mitigating cyberattacks in real-time.
